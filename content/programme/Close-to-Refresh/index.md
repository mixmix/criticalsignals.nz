We are wrapping up Critical Signals for 2025 with a party - you are all warmly
invited to join on Saturday 27th from 6:00pm for reflections and conversation
with drink and light snacks. Please join us as we celebrate and reflect on all
of the connections, discoveries and understandings nurtured during this initial
phase of Critical Signals, and dream together of what's next.
