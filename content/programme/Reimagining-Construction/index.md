This presentation examines how the principles of participatory, circular, and open design can transform construction by bringing human and ecological values into the heart of how we build.

Drawing from both ancient timber framing traditions and modern innovations, it demonstrates how modularity and standardisation unlock flexibility, efficiency, and customisation while supporting sustainable, locally-rooted solutions.

A key focus is placed on design for disassembly and reassembly, enabling buildings and their components to be reused and adapted over timeâ€”reducing waste, lowering environmental impact, and fostering resilience for current and future communities.
