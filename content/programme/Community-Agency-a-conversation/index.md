Climate change, loss of biodiversity, migration, plastic in our blood and
brains – it is only a short step towards the belief that we are utterly
f%$#&…

Understanding how these global crises are interlinked, and how people cope
with these is part of this evening. It brings together two researchers from
two quite distinct fields – computer science and psychological science
– who will talk about their perspectives on how to handle complex and systemic
crises. Markus looks at the world as a giant heap of information across many
and diverse scales, and seeks to analytically understand this through the means
of information and network theory. Gerhard addresses our cognitive and
emotional responses to these crises, and how they shape our mental health and
ultimately, action. We look forward for a fruit- and hopeful evening in the
face of planetary doom.
