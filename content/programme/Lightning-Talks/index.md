Short presentations (less than 15min) from the wider community on disaster
preparedness, food / tech sovereignty.

This is an opportunity to care/ be curious, role model learning, invite
connections, start conversations (and maybe collaborations).


## What makes a good lightning talk?

- Talk on a topic you have passion for
- Tell people why you care
- Who’s in the room? _(what context they might need to connect with what you’re
  sharing?)_
