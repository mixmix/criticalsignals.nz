**How to be a Tree **\
\
“It’s simple,” they say, “and you too have come into the world to do this, to go easy, to be filled with light, and to shine.”  \
- When I am among the Trees by Mary Oliver   \
\
How do we nourish our wairuatanga, listening deeply to our own inner critical signals, when we're seeing the natural world collapse and repair around us? \
\
Through Qi Gong, Zen Buddhism and Deep Listening, how can this aliveness continue to be taken care of as the winds blow stronger? \

**The Peninsula**\
\
Paige's research contributes to the field of disaster risk reduction by utilising visual storytelling to emphasise the critical role of resilient communities in mitigating the impacts of climate-accelerated disasters, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. \
\
The Peninsula, a fictional pānui designed by Paige, explores the mātauranga Māori principle of whakawhanaungatanga through the depiction of ordinary members from the Miramar Peninsula community in tongue-in-cheek survival situations during an ongoing zombie catastrophe. Leveraging Wellingtonians' appreciation for b-horror/humour storytelling seen in productions such as What We Do in the Shadows and Wellington Paranormal, the use of humour and the spectacle of a zombie context is an engaging narrative experience for readers to consider their contributions within their community in an emergency.
