Aotearoa faces multiple natural hazard risks, both seismic and weather-related.
Partly for this reason, the cost of residential property insurance is
relatively high, certainly by European standards. Moreover, average premiums
have risen dramatically in recent decades. According to StatsNZ, the average
cost of house insurance has increased by over 900% since the year 2000, with a
substantial proportion of this increase occurring since 2022. As a result,
insurance affordability issues are escalating. Additionally, over the coming
decades, the impacts of climate change, including more severe flooding and sea
level rise, are bound to reduce the availability of residential property
insurance in high-risk locations. But reduced insurance affordability and
availability will likely harm societal resilience.

Drawing on various overseas policy approaches, this presentation will explore
the longer-term policy options for residential property insurance, and
especially natural disaster insurance, in the context of increasing
climate-related risks. The options include extending the role of the Natural
Hazards Commission to include the full range of climate-related perils,
replacing the Commissionâ€™s role as the first-loss insurer of specified perils
with different cover arrangements, and expanding the current regime of
means-tested insurance subsidies. Every option has disadvantages.
