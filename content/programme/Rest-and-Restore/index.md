Climate and Community Activist Tuhi-ao Bailey will talk about Parihaka’s steps towards kai sovereignty, their award winning māra kai and planning a papakāinga to be resilient in the face of Climate Change.

This will be followed by an action-focused discussion led by chef and grower Mara Masarotti on how to connect urban growers with spaces to grow kai at scale.
