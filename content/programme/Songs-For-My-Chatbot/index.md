Generative AI is everywhere. Each campaign presents it as an efficiency fix,
often for problems it invented. Yet efficiency collapses in fields that thrive
on the very search for problems. In the creative arts, including music, the
goal usually is not to solve problems; it’s to seek them, wrestle with them and
forge novel, unexpected forms of expression. That clash between algorithmic
speed, and the creative value of exploration sets the stage for this session.
In this lecture, composer and AI researcher Misagh Azimi will showcase headline
systems created to generating music and discuss the politics and carbon costs
embedded in their creation, training, and data use. We’ll then trace the
economic cracks beneath copyright, royalty streams, and cultural value, before
outlining ways to intervene through personal fine-tuning, transparent datasets,
and collaborative, human-centered workflows.
