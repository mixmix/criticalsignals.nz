The Playful Revolution is seeking up to 10 collaborative, open-minded creators
who will explore, the potential impact of a major natural hazard event in the
heart of Wellington’s Central City and work together to create an educational
video to help others prepare.

This 2-day workshop will be led by Alex Bonham and Sophie Jerram, with
experience in community generation, music, social practice, performance, and
local government.  This comes from a piece created a year ago with Vogelmorn
Community - see https://vimeo.com/1068659998

We are looking for willing community actors, those with a specific interest and
knowledge of emergency preparedness and Wellington apartment residents.
Preference will be given to people who can come both days.

Natural Hazards specialist Finn Ilsey-Kemp from Victoria University will speak
to the group about what we face geologically - on Friday 12.30-2:00pm - as part
of the workshop programme.
