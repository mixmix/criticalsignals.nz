Your community needs you!

The Playful Revolution is seeking up to 25 collaborative, open-minded creators who will explore, with the guidance of geologists and Emergency Response professionals, the potential impact of a major natural hazard event in the heart of Wellingtonâ€™s Central City and work together to create an educational video to help others prepare.  

This 2-day workshop will be led by Alex Bonham, Sophie Jerram and Finn Ilsey-Kemp, with experience in community generation, music, social practice, performance, and local government.

They are looking for actors, those with a specific interest and knowledge of emergency preparedness and Wellington apartment residents. Preference will be given to people who can come both days.

Natural Hazards specialist Finn Ilsey-Kemp from Victoria University will speak to the group about what we face geologically - on Friday 12.30-2:00pm - as part of the workshop programme.

Friday 8 August 10:00am-4:00pm + 
Saturday 9 August 2:00pm-5:30pm
