Capitalism’s drive for continuous growth fuels resource depletion and inequality across the built and natural environment. In this talk, Melbourne-based architect and academic Jacqui Alexander presents a series of critical and creative works that reimagine the agency and politics of design in the face of the dual crises of climate and capital.

Through architectural and cultural projects that respond to the impacts of capitalism’s extractive digital and material technologies, Jacqui explores what it means to design for coexistence. Her practice centres collaboration across disciplines, audiences, and communities – building a “common sense” of spatial and climate injustice as a foundation for collective action.

_Sensing the Quarry_ (2024-25) by architect Jacqui Alexander, artist Polly Stanton and designer Paul Mylecharane is on show at Critical Signals 9-21 September.
