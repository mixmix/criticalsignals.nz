This light-hearted talk will introduce some old, some new and some eccentric
ideas for keeping computers and their software running for as long as we can.
Come and learn some tricks to fight planned obsolescence and also build new
things that might survive the onslaught of corporate capture. We'll be
streaming this talk from aboard a little sailboat adrift somewhere in the
Pacific! No prior knowledge of computing required.
