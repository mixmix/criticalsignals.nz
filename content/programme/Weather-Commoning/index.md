The Japanese government's Moonshot Goal 8 project aims to create a society safe
from extreme winds and rains by controlling the weather by 2050. Led by Kosei
Yamaguchi (Kyoto University), a key part of the project is developing devices
like turbines, curtains, and cloud seeding to calm (not control) extreme rain.
The Weather Commons Research Group, led by Tsuyoshi Hatori (Ehime University),
is developing and exploring 'weather commoning’. This involves the exploration
of symbiotic relationships with weather patterns and disasters, non-normative
ethics based on local community practices, and citizen participation in
technological development.

Please join weather commons group leader Tsuyoshi Hatori and member Chris
Berthelsen (originally Tāmaki Makaurau) for an introduction to the state of
weather control, calming, and commoning research and activity in Japan. This is
a space for open discussion, but you are also free to sit back and listen.

**Synopsis**: An intro to weather control, calming, and commoning research and
activity in Japan, where the government aims to have some control over severe
weather by 2050.
