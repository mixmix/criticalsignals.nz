The Japanese government’s Moonshot Goal 8 project aims to create a society safe from extreme winds and rains by controlling the weather by 2050. As a core part of Moonshot Goal 8, the Heavy Rainfall Control project led by Kosei Yamaguchi (Kyoto University) is developing devices like turbines, curtains, and cloud seeding to calm extreme rain. Within this project the Weather Commons Research Group, led by Tsuyoshi Hatori (Ehime University), is developing and exploring ‘weather commoning’. This involves the exploration of symbiotic relationships with weather patterns and disasters, non-normative ethics based on local community practices, and citizen participation in technological development.

Please join weather commons group leader Tsuyoshi Hatori and member Chris
Berthelsen (originally from Tāmaki Makaurau) for an introduction to the state of
weather control, calming, and commoning research and activity in Japan. This is
a space for open discussion, but you are also free to sit back and listen.

**Synopsis**: An intro to weather control, calming, and commoning research and
activity in Japan, where the government aims to have some control over severe
weather by 2050.
