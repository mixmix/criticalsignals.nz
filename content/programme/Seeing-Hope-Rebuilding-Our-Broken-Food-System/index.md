Dr Jessica Hutchings has been leading and researching Indigenous food systems
for decades, working from Papawhakaritorito, the farm she shares with Jo Smith
at Kaitoke.  Jo and Jessica teach hua parakore, a kaupapa Māori system and
framework for growing Kai Atua (Māori organic kai) and in November 2024 they
published the book Pātaka Kai, which celebrates abundant food communities
throughout Aotearoa.   In October 2024, Jess and Jo led mana wahine to Vandana
Shiva’s Navdanya centre in India to present a Mana Wāhine Declaration on Seed
and Soil.

Jessica will talk about the three pillars of seed, soil sovereignty and kai
sovereignty as key food food futures as well as what it means to be in right
relationship with our soil, seed and food systems.
