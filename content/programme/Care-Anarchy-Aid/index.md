When we think about acute and chronic disasters, who are we relying on to
drive change? In the face of institutional gaps and uncertainty -- what can we
do for ourselves, together? This korero is rooted in exploring what community
care looks like in the face of disaster and ongoing polycrises, and what each
of us can do to organise collectively around our needs. We will walk through
tangible examples from Monica's experiences of mutual aid organizing for
different crisis contexts in Chicago (USA), dispelling disaster myths, what
anarchist approaches to community care look like, and brainstorming around
what we can do together around what we face as community members in Te
Whanganui-a-Tara.  Zines and kai will be shared.
