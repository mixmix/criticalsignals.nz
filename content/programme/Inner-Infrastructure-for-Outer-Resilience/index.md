In a time of ecological crisis and accelerating uncertainty, how we show up - internally - matters more than ever. 
This 90-minute session invites you into a deeper inquiry: what if the most critical signals aren't just out there, but within us?

Blending insights from yoga, nervous system science, and psychology, this workshop explores how cultivating somatic awareness, emotional integration, and nervous system literacy can help us meet this moment with resilience and relational wisdom.

We'll look at:



- How (& why it matters) to expand our bandwidth of intelligence beyond the mind—into the body, breath, and felt experience


- Simple practices to regulate our nervous systems and stay connected in the face of discomfort, conflict or overwhelm


- The power of transmuting difficult emotions (like fear, grief or anger) into clarity and compassionate action


- How mindset, perception and bias shape the stories we tell ourselves, and how those stories shape the world we build

- Why the relational field we create may matter more than the facts we present or the causes we champion

This is an invitation to slow down, tune in, and build inner infrastructure for a more resilient, connected, and intentional future. 

Come as you are - this session will be gentle, experiential, and open to all levels of awareness or practice.

As Rumi reminds us: “Yesterday I was clever and tried to change the world; today I am wise and am changing myself.”
