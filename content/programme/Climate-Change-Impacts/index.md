The warming climate is delivering increasingly extreme floods, droughts, heat
waves, and fires around the world and in New Zealand. The globe is also
approaching a range of tipping points that could be very challenging to adapt
to. This talk will review where weâ€™re at with climate change, the context for
recent extremes in Aotearoa and internationally, and what we might expect over
the coming few decades. It will end with a review of the actions we need to
take to lead us to a brighter future.
