This talk, "Economic Modeling of Climate Change" is in place of the one by James Renwick that has had to be postponed. 
We want to express our heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Cathrine Dyer for bringing her talk forward.

Integrated assessment models combine climate science with economics to evaluate climate policies. However, it is argued 
that they systematically underestimate risk and promote complacency. This undermines attempts to inform the public and 
to generate appropriate climate action. Join us for a quick tour of what these models do, where some of the issues lie 
and what recommendations are being made for assessing climate risk using different approaches.
