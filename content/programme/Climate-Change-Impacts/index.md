This talk, "Economic Modeling of Climate Change" is in place of the one by James Renwick that has had to be postponed. 
We want to express our heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Cathrine Dyer for bringing her talk forward. We will have an outline of the talk for you soon.


Cathrine Dyer is a Lecturer in Climate Change at Te Herenga Waka Victoria
University of Wellington. She teaches  environmental poltiics and international
climate change policy. Her PhD research examined government underreactions to
climate change, leading to an interest in commons expansion and collective
responses. Cathrine is a regular guest on The Hoon podcast, covering current
climate change issues with journalists Bernard Hickey (The Kākā) and Peter
Bale.
