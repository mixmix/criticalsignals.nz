As the Christchurch Earthquake and Cyclone Gabrielle have shown, in an
environmental disaster, Internet infrastructure and mobile communications are
unreliable at best.

This 2 hour session will introduce participants to the Meshtastic platform, a
post-internet mesh network in broad use in Pōneke/Wellington. Meshtastic allows
for sending messages even in a total blackout, right from your phone. The Lower
North Island already enjoys a very populous and active Meshtastic mesh, with
many members focused on preparedness. Come and learn how you can help strengthen
and grow the community!
