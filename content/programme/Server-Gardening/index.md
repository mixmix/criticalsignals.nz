This lecture by Julian Oliver positions the deployment of self-hosted,
community-owned sovereign server infrastructure as a radical act of
infrastructural resistance in an age of polluting and pervasive digital
imperialism.

In doing so, Julian will look closely as to what it really means to run one's
own server, from potentials to pitfalls, whether that be an old PC
turned-server hosted at home, studio or office, or on a machine rented at a
datacenter.

Starting points for self-hosting will be covered, with an introduction to
system administration in the context of digital caretaker, guardian and
gardener. 

The talk will also assess free and open source platform alternatives to Big
Tech platforms, from sovereign cloud, webmail, forum, team chat, and more.
Each will be discussed such that participants can better get a sense of the
what awaits them on their self-hosting journey.
