This lecture, delivered by Julian Oliver, will introduce participants to the
potentials and pitfalls of self-hosted server infrastructure, whether that be a
PC-turned-server hosted at home, studio or office, or on a server rented at a
datacenter. Starting points for self-hosting will be covered, with an
introduction to system administration in the context of digital caretaker,
guardian and gardener. The lecture will position self-hosting as an act of
infrastructural resistance and reclamation in an era of pervasive digital
imperialism and extractivism.

The talk will also assess free and open source platform alternatives to Big
Tech, from cloud, to webmail, forum, team chat, and more.
