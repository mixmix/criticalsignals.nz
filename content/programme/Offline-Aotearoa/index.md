This fun, one day session builds upon a simple thought experiment: Aotearoa
wakes up one day disconnected from the Internet, and the rest of the world.
However, local infrastructure, from cell towers, to datacentres and fibre
networks, remain unscathed. What could (or couldn't) we do with what we have?
What of our current network and communications infrastructure, and all our most
used sites and services, would function when we’re ‘cut off’ from the rest of
civilisation?

Join us in a playful lab environment helping build the first ‘map’ of what our
digital experience would look like if it was just us - from healthcare, to
education, banking and the big socials. In doing so, we’ll get a sense of just
how infrastructurally independent - and resilient - we are as a nation.

Participants will learn how to use simple network probing and website analysis
to pull websites and networks apart, looking under the hood at just how much is
hosted overseas.

This is a team effort, with no prior knowledge required. Participants should
bring a laptop.
