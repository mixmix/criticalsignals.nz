This half-day session builds upon a simple thought experiment: Aotearoa wakes
up one day disconnected from the Internet, and the rest of the world, yet all
the while local communications infrastructure - from cell towers, to
datacentres and fibre networks - remain unscathed. 

What could (or couldn't) we do with what we have?  What of our current network
and communications infrastructure, our most used sites and services, would
continue to function if we were cut off from the rest of human civilisation? 

Join us in a playful lab environment helping build the first ‘map’ of what our
digital experience would look like if it was just us - from healthcare, to
education, banking and the big socials. In doing so, we’ll get a sense of just
how infrastructurally independent and resilient we are as a nation.

Participants will learn how to use network probing and website analysis tools
to pull websites and networks apart, looking under the hood at just how much
of our digital reality is hosted overseas.

This is a team effort, with no prior knowledge required. Participants should
bring a laptop.
