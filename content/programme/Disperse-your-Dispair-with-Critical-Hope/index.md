The thought of an imminent disaster weighing you down? Current world politics leaving you despondent? This workshop will explore how critical hope can be practiced through the process of collective letter writing. Critical (as opposed to passive) hope is grounded in reality and is an action driven practice. Using letter making as a creative method that allows for imagination, this practice of hope will promote engagement, rather than distancing from current and future political, climate and justice problems. This workshop aims to reground participants in a non-digital world, as well as foster collaboration, imagination, and optimism for the future.
