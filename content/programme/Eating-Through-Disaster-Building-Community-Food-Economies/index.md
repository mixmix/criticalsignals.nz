Our existing food system in Aotearoa contains deep inequities, meaning that not everyone is able to enjoy food security or to have reliable access to quality healthy food. In time of disaster these inequities are significantly heightened, but it doesnâ€™t have to be this way. In this panel session we will explore existing initiatives and approaches that offer a different way of doing things.

The speakers engage with a community economy approach that focuses on how to build economies that prioritise the wellbeing of communities and the planet, rather than focusing on profit. There are plentiful examples of community economies already in action in Aotearoa and this panel focuses on examples of how they have been mobilised to address concerns with food supply. We review the lessons from community-based responses to food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, consider the ongoing role of food rescue for disaster risk reduction, and explore how these examples show how community food economies can help to build more equitable and resilient food systems, and foster more resilient communities during peace-time and disasters. The session will end with facilitated discussion around what other examples of community food economies exist locally and how these can be harnessed so that our communities not only survive, but are able to thrive through disaster.
