“Crashes, fires and floods may simply be entropy in action, but systemically
concentrated and risky infrastructures are choices made manifest — and we can
make better ones.” Maria Farrell, Rewilding the Internet   What if we looked
at the Internet not with helpless horror of its current controllers, but with
compassion, constructiveness and hope? Technologists are great at incremental
fixes, but we can learn from ecologists who take a whole-systems view.
Ecologists also know how to keep going when others first ignore you and then
say it’s too late, how to mobilize and work collectively, and how to build
pockets of diversity and resilience that will outlast them, creating
possibilities for an abundant future they can imagine but never control. We
don’t need to repair the internet’s infrastructure. We need to rewild it.
