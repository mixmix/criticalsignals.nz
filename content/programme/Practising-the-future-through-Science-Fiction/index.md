_“One of the biggest roles of science fiction is to prepare people to accept
the future without pain and to encourage a flexibility of the mind.”_  -- Arthur
C Clarke

Matt Boyd develops evidence-based foresight scenarios on global catastrophic
risks and responses, providing foundations for role-playing, storytelling, and
resilience planning. In his work, Matt asks what might enable island societies
like Aotearoa to endure a collapse?

Dr Doug Van Belle is a published science
fiction author, exploring the politics of extreme resource scarcity in his
latest novel. As a university researcher, he analyses the role of science
fiction in society, and the role of media in disaster risk reduction.

Both will share insights they have gleaned from the practice of imagining a future
that is radically different to the past, discussing how fictional accounts can
help communities to prepare for rapid change
