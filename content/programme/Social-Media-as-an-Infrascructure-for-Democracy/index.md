Evan Henshaw-Plath, known as "rabble," is an activist and technologist
passionate about building commons-based social media apps that prioritize
equity and sustainability.  As the head of the tech team at Odeo when Twitter
was created, rabble has unique insights into how social media platforms evolve
and the values that shape them.   Rabble will discuss how social media should
support democratic processes rather than be a business model for surveillance.
