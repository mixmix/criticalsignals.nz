Working in community and sharing responsibilty for common goals can be a way
out of the bleakness of late stage capitalism. This workship is invitation to
hear and share stories from collectivism, to meet others in the city walking
these paths.

We'll seed the dialogue with stories from Vogelmorn community, Protozoa Coop,
Enspiral Services on themes such as income sharing, cooperative business,
shared ownership, community assets. Please bring your stories of success,
challenge, and growth <3
