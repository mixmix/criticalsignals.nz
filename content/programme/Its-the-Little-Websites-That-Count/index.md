For most current technology, it is assumed that the user is always online and
has access to unlimited data. But this assumption is only valid for regions
with the infrastructure to support the internet.  As more vital communications
and services transition into websites, how do we make sure that these services
are still usable in areas with only low bandwidth internet or during natural
disasters?  In this event we will start a discussion about developing smaller
websites for accessibility in Aotearoa.
