You are invited to join us for the launch of Critical Signals, a three-month public space for learning, imagining, and practising how sovereignty, resilience and collective care will shape our futures in times of rapid change.

Please join us for karakia, talks, kai, wai and connection as we celebrate the launch of the project.
