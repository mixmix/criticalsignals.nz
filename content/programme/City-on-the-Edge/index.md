Wellington owes much of its natural beauty to the tectonic plate boundary
beneath our feet, one which also brings the reality of geological hazards.
Finn will show how these geological events have shaped our region in the past,
and what we might expect in the future.  There will always be uncertainty about
these future hazards, but scientists and historians can combine to better
prepare us for what is coming.
