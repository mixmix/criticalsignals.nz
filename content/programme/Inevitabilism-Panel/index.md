We're told 'AI' is Progress, progress that cannot be stopped, that it will change the way we work and live, from business to education and the commons.
But who says? Whose progress and whose AI is it anyway?  Is societal progress really bound to technological innovation, or are there other ways of reading -
and even shaping -  positive social change?

Technological Determinism is described as the belief system that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an
"inevitable" course." This panel will take a good hard look at this 'inevitabilism' - its forces and politics - with a view to our shared future
in Aotearoa and the Pacific. 

Join us for a rigorous evening of discussion with a view to how we might gain more understanding - and more say - as to the reach and influence new
technologies have over our autonomy, dignity, communities and cultures.
