An introduction to Coshop, a new open source platform connecting communities directly to local farmers that is being trialled in Wellington with Kaibosh and Wesley Community Action. 

This talk will also look at existing models of community engagement in food systems, some problems with the existing models and how tech could enable communities and small farmers to regain power in the food system.
