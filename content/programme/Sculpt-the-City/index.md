Get hands-on with air-dry clay as we reimagine Wellington’s CBD at scale. In
this collaborative workshop, we’ll explore how we think about natural hazard
risk and resilience—through shape, texture, and place.

By treating the city as a model we can mold, you’ll gain new insights into
scale, design, and the ways we interpret our shared environment. No experience
is needed—just bring your curiosity, your observational eye, and a willingness
to work with others.

The clay city model of the Wellington CBD you help create will be a central
reference point throughout the Critical Signals series. 

We suggest making a koha of around $5 to cover materials used in this event.
