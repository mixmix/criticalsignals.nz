This one day event will involve getting out and about around Wellington CBD in
an attempt to map it for radio shadows (communication blindspots) within the
Lower North Island Meshtastic network. Meshtastic allows for sending messages
even in a total blackout, right from your phone. The outcome will be a map which
identifies areas where we need to install nodes to give coverage across the CBD.
These could become mission-critical to reaching loved ones in the event of an
earthquake or blackout event. We will meet at Critical Signals, 115 Taranaki
Street, then head out into the city, rain or shine.
