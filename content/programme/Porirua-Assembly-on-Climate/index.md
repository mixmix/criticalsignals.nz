*****************

Cally O'Neill (p훮keh훮) is one of the founders of Te Reo Ng훮 T훮ngata/The People
Speak, who have worked with Ngati Toa over several years on Te Tiriti-based
deliberative processes to strengthen democracy and improve outcomes for people
and place, recently holding an Assembly on Climate for the Porirua region.
She will talk about the assembly process and on a tool kit that is being rolled
out for communities to become more involved in their environmental futures.
