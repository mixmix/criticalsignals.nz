Join us to create and map together our shared knowledge and assets to build collective community resilience. No prior knowledge needed!

 

Anna Brown is a research co-lead of the project [Ngā Ngaru Wakapuke](https://ngangaruwakapuke.nz/); a climate and disaster research project. As part of this mapping exercise she will share her work with several communities in Tairāwhiti, Wairarapa and Ōtautahi/Christchurch around mapping, disaster resilience and storytelling. She describes maps as more than locational tools; as a way to build a common understanding of shared assets.

Anna will lead us through an exercise to record Wellington CBD’s community points of interest, that will be added to over the course of Critical Signals.
