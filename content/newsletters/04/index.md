## Week Three reflection from core team collaborator Julian Oliver

It was a busy week for the data and digital infrastructure track of Critical
Signals. Offline Aotearoa!, a half-day workshop on digital infrastructure
sovereignty, led by me, Julian Oliver. Participants command line learn tools to
dig behind the surface of Aotearoa New Zealand‚Äôs digital infrastructure to find
where the services of our government and public sector are geographically and
jurisdictionally located. It is clear that many of the server we consider ‚Äòour
own‚Äô are in fact on privately owned datacenters far away, and often on US-owned
and controlled property. While we Aotearoa New Zealanders might think of
ourselves as politically, culturally and economically sovereign, we are very
much not so when it comes to the digital infrastructure we use everyday. Week
Three reflection from core team collaborator [Julian Oliver](/collaborators/julian/)
 
Whena Owen, from TVNZ‚Äôs Q&A spent time at Critical Signals (115 Taranaki St) to
chat about these themes, resulting in a story [airing on Sunday
morning](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/shows/q-and-a/clips/digital-activists-moving-data-out-of-trump-s-america-q-a-2025).

On Thursday a talk was held in the space introducing the post-Internet offline
communications platform Meshtastic, for which an already thriving
community-owned-and-operated network in the Lower North Island already exists.
Meshtastic is a resilient ‚Äòmesh-networking‚Äô technology allowing users to stay
in touch with text messages from their smartphones even in a total power and
Internet blackout. Rather than pushed as a complete ‚Äòtechno-fix‚Äô for
disaster-tolerant communications, Meshtastic was discussed as meeting needs not
covered by traditional AM radio emergency broadcasts from authorities, rather
empowering communities to organise and meet their own needs in a crisis.
 
On Saturday, participants of this talk met to identify ‚Äòblind spots‚Äô in the
CBD, with a view to placing new mesh ‚Äònodes‚Äô in the city to increase coverage.
From this session, several new locations for nodes were identified, with one
large blind spot found through live testing at the wharf. For this the team
proved a node at the top of Taranaki street would open up connectivity for not
just all of Taranaki street, but much of the harbour itself.

## Location Identification

![](./street.jpg)

Our new low tech highly responsive location identification system created by
Ollie Hutton - a signal that Critical Signals is in through the glass doors
rather than the grey 115 door [that's home to our beautiful friends Supergood]
 

_**Apologies to Ed Strafford who we erroneously referred to as Ed Burn in last
weeks signal!**_

## Support

![](./pledgeme.png)

To support the project, we are seeking $9,000 to be able to steward the
physical space, but any further Pledges will greatly help us to get Critical
Signals up and running. Your Pledges will cover the lease of the building, and
enable the team to deliver a series of seminars and workshops.
 
The success of Critical Signals depends on community support. The space will be
a hub for learning, k≈çrero, and creative experimentation‚Äîoffering opportunities
to simply connect or dive into hands-on activities.
