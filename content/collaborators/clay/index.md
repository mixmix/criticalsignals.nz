Clay is a culture scout and local music lover from Te Whanganui-a-Tara who
believes that community and knowledge are too important to be gatekept by
profit-driven, unelected power hoarders. Moved by their dream of
community-owned spaces that spark our commitments and feed our spirits, their
multidisciplinary work seeks to stitch our contextual fabrics into collective
power, providing alternative narratives to rising techno-tyrannies. With a
background including hospitality, event production, permaculture and
software-oriented product management, they are now focused on creating
conditions for experimentation, play, and learning - especially together.
