Clay is a culture scout and local music lover from Te Whanganui-a-Tara who believes that community and knowledge are too important to be gatekept by profit-driven, unelected power hoarders. Moved by their dream of community-owned spaces that spark our commitments and feed our spirits, their multidisciplinary work seeks to stitch our contextual fabrics into collective power, providing alternative narratives to rising techno-tyrannies. With a background including hospitality, event production, permaculture and software-oriented product management, they are now focused on creating conditions for experimentation, play, and learning - especially together.
