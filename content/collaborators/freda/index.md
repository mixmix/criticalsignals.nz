Freda is a curator, engagement practitioner, and connector, who works at the intersection of social change, community-building, and inner development. She is the Founder of the Goodlife Collective, which curates spaces that build connection, wellbeing and collective wisdom.

Drawing on yoga teaching, somatic practices and adult development, Freda is interested in how we build our inner infrastructure - the capacity to work through discomfort, reconnect with our agency, and bring greater presence to relationships. Her background is in psychology, environmental-science and design, and she loves nerding out on ideas and conversations about unlocking our collective potential.
