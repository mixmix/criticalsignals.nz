A multidisciplinary myth-making artist, a self described 'polymath peace
pilgrim' recently returned home to the harbour, and now nestling in the wing of
his co-founded arts collective Mouthfull. With film, music, dance and poetry as
ongoing plays; meditations and space-making embody most of Ollie’s practice.
