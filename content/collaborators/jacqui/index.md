Jacqui Alexander is a Senior Lecturer in Architecture at Monash Art Design and
Architecture, and a Director of Alexander & Sheridan Architecture. Her research
explores practices of resistance against the financialisation of the built
environment via extractive technologies. She is interested in interdisciplinary
and intersectional forms of creative practice as a means to develop new
understandings, tools and coalitions in responding to these structural
challenges.
