Markus Luczak-Roesch is Professor of Informatics and the inaugural Chair in
Complexity Science at Victoria University of Wellington’s School of Information
Management. He is also one of two Co-Directors of Te Pūnaha Matatini, Aotearoa
New  Zealand’s Centre of Research Excellence in Complex Systems. He founded and
leads the Complexity & Connection Science Lab, an interdisciplinary group
developing theories and computational tools to understand how complex systems
unfold over time. His research investigates how structure and meaning emerge in
systems - from language and brain activity to online communities and the
environment - using models that reveal meaningful coincidences and unexpected
system-level behaviors.
